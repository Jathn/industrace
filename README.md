**Industrace** is a comprehensive Industrial Asset Management System designed for managing and monitoring industrial equipment, networks, and infrastructure. Built with FastAPI backend and Vue.js frontend, it provides a modern, scalable solution for industrial environments.

It was born from a simple observation: most asset management tools are designed for IT, while the industrial world requires different logic ‚Äî mapping systems against the Purdue model, assessing risk with ICS-specific parameters, and documenting operational infrastructure in a structured way.

üëâ Industrace is meant to be a starting point: easy to deploy, preloaded with demo data, and most importantly open to contributions and real-world use cases.
We don‚Äôt claim to cover everything from day one, but we believe many organizations ‚Äî large and small ‚Äî face similar needs.

## ü§ñ Built with Human Expertise + AI Support

Industrace was developed combining hands-on expertise in cybersecurity with the support of AI tools throughout the development process.

This means two things:

üõ†Ô∏è The project was built faster and with broader perspectives, leveraging AI to explore solutions and speed up coding.

üåç The code and documentation are designed to be clear, structured, and accessible ‚Äî a direct result of the ‚ÄúAI-assisted‚Äù approach.

We like to think of Industrace as an experiment in human + AI co-creation, where the open source community can now take the lead to validate, extend, and adapt it to real-world industrial environments.

Last thing..
Born in Italy, Industrace combines European attention to industrial processes with a global open-source mindset.
